# Circular Dependency Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The warning message indicated that removing the call to `cleanupEmptyBraces` from the `fixUnmatchedBraces` function would change the expected behavior. This was indeed a valid concern, as the cleanup of empty braces is required functionality for proper delimiter balance handling.

## Root Cause Analysis

The circular dependency issue arose from the following pattern:

1. **In `test-specific-issues.js`:**
   - `processExpression()` called `fixUnmatchedBraces()` (line 46)
   - `fixUnmatchedBraces()` internally called `cleanupEmptyBraces()` (line 39)
   - `processExpression()` then called `cleanupEmptyBraces()` again (line 47)
   - This pattern repeated multiple times throughout the processing pipeline

2. **In `app.js`:**
   - Similar pattern existed where `fixUnmatchedBraces()` was called multiple times
   - Each call to `fixUnmatchedBraces()` triggered `cleanupEmptyBraces()` internally
   - This created redundant cleanup operations and potential circular dependencies

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Refactored `fixUnmatchedBraces` Function

**Before:**
```javascript
function fixUnmatchedBraces(str) {
    // ... brace fixing logic ...
    
    // Apply cleanup after fixing braces to maintain expected behavior
    return cleanupEmptyBraces(result);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function fixUnmatchedBraces(str) {
    // ... brace fixing logic ...
    
    // Return result without cleanup - cleanup should be handled externally
    return result;
}
```

### 2. Updated Calling Code

**In `test-specific-issues.js`:**
- Added explicit `cleanupEmptyBraces()` calls after each `fixUnmatchedBraces()` call
- Updated the processing pipeline to handle cleanup externally

**In `app.js`:**
- Updated `processTypoFixes()` method to call `cleanupEmptyBraces()` after `fixUnmatchedBraces()`
- Updated the main processing pipeline to call `cleanupEmptyBraces()` after `fixUnmatchedBraces()`

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Eliminates Circular Dependency:** The `fixUnmatchedBraces` function no longer has an internal dependency on `cleanupEmptyBraces`
2. **Maintains Expected Behavior:** All cleanup operations are still performed, just at the appropriate points in the calling code
3. **Improves Performance:** Reduces redundant cleanup operations by making them explicit and controlled
4. **Better Separation of Concerns:** Each function has a single, clear responsibility
5. **Easier Testing:** The functions can be tested independently without hidden side effects

## Additional Optimization

After the initial refactoring, a redundant consecutive cleanup call was identified and removed:
- **Before:** Two consecutive `cleanupEmptyBraces()` calls (lines 73 and 75)
- **After:** Single cleanup call followed by brace fixing
- **Result:** Improved performance without affecting functionality

## Verification

All tests continue to pass after the refactoring:
- ✅ Test 1: Specific delimiter balance issue from error message
- ✅ Test 2: Expression that might have missing closing brace  
- ✅ Test 3: Expression missing one closing brace
- ✅ Test 4: Expression missing two closing braces
- ✅ Test 5: Simple fraction expression

## Files Modified

1. **`test-specific-issues.js`:**
   - Removed internal `cleanupEmptyBraces()` call from `fixUnmatchedBraces()`
   - Added explicit cleanup calls in `processExpression()` where needed
   - Removed redundant consecutive cleanup calls to improve performance

2. **`src/app.js`:**
   - Removed internal `cleanupEmptyBraces()` call from `fixUnmatchedBraces()` method
   - Added explicit cleanup calls in `processTypoFixes()` method
   - Added explicit cleanup call in the main processing pipeline

## Conclusion

The circular dependency issue has been successfully resolved while maintaining all required functionality. The refactoring improves code maintainability and performance while ensuring that empty brace cleanup continues to work as expected.
